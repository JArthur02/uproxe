# Branch guide

How branches in [JArthur02/uproxe](https://github.com/JArthur02/uproxe) are organized.

## Tier 1 — integration (keep)

| Branch | Role | Base |
|--------|------|------|
| `main` | Default branch; latest accepted μProxy 2.x / v3 gateway release line | — |
| `cursor/v3-proxychains` | Active proxy-chain gateway development; merge here first | `main` |

**Workflow:** feature branches → PR into `cursor/v3-proxychains` → when stable, PR `cursor/v3-proxychains` → `main`.

## Tier 2 — topic / archive (keep, do not delete)

| `cursor/publish-win-x64-zip-35cc` | Immutable pre-chains Win x64 ZIP snapshot |

## Tier 3 — open work (keep until merged)

| Branch | PR | Notes |
|--------|-----|-------|
| `codex/investigate-proxychains-implementation` | [#16](https://github.com/JArthur02/uproxe/pull/16) (open) | proxychains-ng config export |
